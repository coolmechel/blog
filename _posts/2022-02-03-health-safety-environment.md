Working and living in a high-risk environment demands the highest level of safety observation with zero compromise. The tragedy is when an accident that could have been prevented claims lives and wastes resources. What will be the need of making all those paper works on safety but safety does not live with us? 
What happens when in our desire to hit set targets, we compromise and boycott all safety procedures but with zero accidents? The danger of this approach is the weakening of the safety culture prevalent in that establishment and this is passed on to the next generation of employees and then disaster is inevitable.

  > “Safety is not an intellectual exercise to keep us in work. It is a matter of life and death. It is the sum of our contributions to safety management that determines whether the people we work with live or die.” – _Sir Brian Appleton_

### Health
The health function typically deals with the well-being of the employees as they live and work in the E&P environment. Typically, the health function focuses on the effects of oilfield chemicals and oilfield physical environment on employees.

### Safety

The safety function focuses on protecting the employee from risk involved in E&P operations. All E&P operations involve some risk from operational hazards. The safety function seeks to minimize these risks and monitor the effectiveness of the minimization activities.

### Environment

The environmental function focuses on the effects E&P have on the external environment. Typically, the discipline deals with those effect that occurs outside the E&P footprint. Included are the effects of air emissions, waste water discharges, and disposal of waste.

**“Every accident is a notice that something is wrong with men, methods, or material.**

##### We should not wait for accidents to teach us the lessons we keep ignoring in safety observation.
