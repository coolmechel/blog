    <td> I switched discipline after my undergraduate studies when I got exposed to Information Technology and how much relevant this skill is in solving African problems. Over the past years, I have been steadily improving on my skills in IT, as I mentioned above, I concluded a specialization in Google IT Support which has given me a lot of confidence in my field.Data science comes highly recommended from tech mentors as one grows to managerial roles in this field, with the rate at which data is being generated, this skill is no longer a desire but a necessity for IT professionals to thrive, from making sense of log data, to driving sales based on data analysis to having self-driving car which is powered by artificial intelligence (AI) these AI algorithms are powered by bigdata. This skill is also a requisite as I work towards becoming a Machine learning engineer, the course will further horn my data wrangling skills, data visualization skill, data base manipulation skills which are most relevant to a Machine learning engineer.I also look forward to impacting my immediate environment with this skill by mentoring the younger ones who have similar desires to become data analyst or data scientist.</td>
    <td> The cost of internet in Equatorial Guinea is very expensive, I am currently spending about $100 monthly on internet, furthermore, there is a lot of limitation for making international payment from here due to government policies on foreign exchange, making credit card payment not very affordable from here and sometimes, it is not even available.
    I participated in the recently concluded program sponsored by the government on Coursera that enabled me to finish a specialization on Google IT support under three months and this had improved my career journey.
    In order to further advance my skillset, I will love to consolidate and continuously improve myself in the field of data analysis. My ability to conclude the Google IT Support Specialization under three months is an evident that I have the discipline and the desire to learn and also finish what I started and this financial aid will be a great boost to my learning trajectory.
    I want to believe that the Coursera and Google's mission is to get the needed skill to those who have the desire and passion to learn. If this is the case, I believe I am qualified for this aid judging from my track record.</td>
