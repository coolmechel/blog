![Focus on what matters](../img/mechanic.jpg "Mechanic workshop")

I got the attention of the director in one of the leading IT firms in Africa when I told him that his team is losing 100hr/annum in administrative works. Excel sheets are great, file servers are super cool, Outlook and Teams are the most common tools at his teamâ€™s disposal and they have been perfect when the subscribers base was just under 200. With the brand now becoming a household name and the subscribers base now going above 500, his team has thus far experienced the limitations these tools can provide and one of which is the lack of automation in the operations.

I have been labelled lazy so many times with regards to how I approach a task, asking a lot of questions saves me valuable time and efforts and I usually tell my colleague that I am not here to reinvent the wheels, I am rather here to leverage the existing structure. Bill Gates once said that he likes lazy people because they will find the path with the least efforts to execute any task and this has been one of my mantra, and this is also the Mantra of the founders of Managed Service Providers (MSP). The battle between the older generation and the Gen Z has always been on how them (older generation) have to go out and work really hard to make a living while the Gen Z just sit at home, make contents and they get paid for that.

MSPS (Managed Service Provider Softare) are software designed to automate and scale up some processes in the operations of service-based enterprise. Things like recurring invoices, contracts and project management are key features in most MSPS and this will save a team of 10 some 100hr lost on administrative task in a year.

Do you still have the mindset of the older generation in managing your human resources? Do you still believe the old ways of paper on file is still what your business needs? The Gen Z as I have observed are lazy but they are getting things done and amassing wealth in the process with all the tools and apps they keep creating to automate most of the boring monotonous jobs of the older generation.
